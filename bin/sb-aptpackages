# Displays number of upgradeable packages via apt.
# For this to work, have a `apt update` command run in the background as a
# cronjob every so often as root using `sudo crontab -e`.
# E.g: to run every 10 minutes and write output to a log file:
# */10 * * * * /usr/bin/apt update >> /var/log/apt-update.log 2>&1
#
# Add a file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/100update
# containing:
# APT::Update::Pre-Invoke  {"/usr/bin/pkill -RTMIN+18 dwmblocks";};
# which will cause this script to be reloaded in dwmblocks everytime the root cronjob runs `apt update`.
# Add another file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/80upgradehook
# containing:
# DPkg::Post-Invoke {"/usr/bin/pkill -RTMIN+18 dwmblocks";};
# which will cause this script to be reloaded in dwmblocks when packages are update via `sudo apt upgrade` or installed via `sudo apt install`.
